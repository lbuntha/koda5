"""Where tenancy is enforced.

Every query in the service is built through `scoped()`, which adds `familyId`
from the *token*. A wrong cell in the permission table then leaks nothing across
families, because the filter never had the other family in it. A repo that
builds a raw filter is the bug to catch in review.
