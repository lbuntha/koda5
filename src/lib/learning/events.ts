/**
 * The learning event schema — one shape, every skill.
 *
 * This is deliberately not the same thing as `SkillActionLog`. That log answers
 * "what did the UI do?" with a free-text string, which is fine for debugging and
 * useless for teaching: you cannot compute mastery from `TAP_ITEM · "tapped a
 * rocket"`. These events answer "what did the child learn, and what tripped them
 * up?", in fields a program can fold.
 *
 * Two rules keep it replicable across skills:
 *
 *  1. **A skill reports facts, never statistics.** It says "this answer was
 *     wrong on attempt 2"; it never computes accuracy or response time. The SDK
 *     derives every number, so counting and addition cannot disagree about what
 *     "accuracy" means.
 *  2. **Mastery is keyed by `conceptKey`, not by skill.** A concept can be
 *     taught by more than one skill, and a skill teaches more than one concept.
 *     Recommendation works on concepts, so adding a skill never means teaching
 *     the recommender about it.
 *
 * Privacy: everything here is about the work, not the child. No names, no free
 * text a child typed, no audio. It stays in this browser (see `learningLog.ts`)
 * and exists so the app can pick a good next lesson.
