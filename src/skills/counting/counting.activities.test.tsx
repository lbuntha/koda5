/**
 * Counting's behaviour tests — the pattern a new skill copies.
 *
 * The kit drives the round; a skill supplies one small function per activity
 * saying how a child answers correctly. That division is the whole design: only
 * the skill knows what its buttons mean, and only the kit knows what a correct
 * round must report to the host.
 *
 * Answers are read back out of the telemetry rather than recomputed here. The
 * activity already tells the host what it expected via `learning.present`, so a
 * test that reads it cannot drift from the activity's own idea of the answer —
 * and a missing `expected` fails the test instead of passing quietly.
