 * A round is the same shape everywhere: ask a question, take answers until one
 * is right, move on, and close out with stars and XP. Both skills wrote that by
 * hand and both got parts of it wrong — counting reported three stars from its
 * first correct answer, addition awarded no XP at all, and each fired the five
 * learning calls in its own order. None of those were hard bugs; they were the
 * cost of writing the same loop twice.
 *
 * A skill supplies the questions and judges the answers. This owns everything
 * between: the counters, the ordering, the telemetry, the score.
