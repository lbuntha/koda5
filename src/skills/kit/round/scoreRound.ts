/**
 * How a finished round turns into stars, XP and coins.
 *
 * One rule for every skill, because the rewards are shared: XP feeds one level,
 * stars fill one path, and a learner meets both across every skill they play.
 * When each skill scored itself, counting handed out a flat 3 stars and 100 XP
 * for finishing at all — accuracy was recorded in the log and ignored by the
 * reward — while addition paid 10 to 30 for the same round. Two scales in one
 * currency makes progress mean nothing, and every new skill made it worse.
 *
 * Stars come from first-try accuracy, not from finishing: a child who needed
 * three attempts on every question has finished the round, and has not mastered
 * it. The learning log already draws that distinction; this makes the reward
 * agree with it.
