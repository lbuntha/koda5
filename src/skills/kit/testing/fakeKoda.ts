 * A KodaSDK that records instead of doing.

 * it takes to run an activity with no app around it. The recording is the point:
 * a skill's contract with the host is *which calls it makes, in what order*, and
 * that is otherwise invisible — a round can look perfect on screen while never
 * filing a single learning event.
