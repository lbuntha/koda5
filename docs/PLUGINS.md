# Koda plugin architecture

A plugin is **one complete skill** — its interactions, its lessons, its settings and its
telemetry — built and owned by one developer in one folder.

This document is the contract to build against. For the migration sequence that gets us
there, see [PLUGIN_BUILD_PLAN.md](./PLUGIN_BUILD_PLAN.md).

> **Status: partly built.** The contract, SDK, host, registry and the counting plugin are in
> the repo and running — counting reaches the learner through `PluginHost`. **Not built:** the
> shared `kit/`, the activity split, `curriculum/course.ts`, routing, and release gating.
> Anything describing those is the target, not current behaviour.

## 1. What exists today

`src/lib/pluginStore.ts` (657 lines) already provides a real plugin layer:

| Capability | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Manifest metadata — id, version, category, author | `LearningPlugin` |
| Per-feature toggles | `PluginFeature[]`, persisted to `localStorage` |
| Per-plugin settings bag | `settings`, e.g. `speechRate`, `hapticIntensity` |
| Telemetry | `PluginManagerAPI.logAction()` |
| Management UI | `src/components/PluginSettingsPanel.tsx` (913 lines) |

Counting already consumes it, e.g. `CountingGameApp.tsx:300`:

```ts
PluginManagerAPI.isFeatureEnabled("counting-mastery", "haptic_feedback", true)
```

### What is missing

1. ~~**No `component` field.**~~ **Fixed.** `SkillPlugin.activities` supplies components and
   `PluginHost` mounts them; `App.tsx` no longer imports `CountingGameApp`.
2. **The skill still escapes the shell.** `PluginHost` renders outside `MainLayout`, so
   counting loses the sidebar and page padding, and hardcodes 6 dark surfaces that ignore the
   theme. (M5, M7.)
3. **Cross-plugin logging.** `CountingGameApp.tsx:717` logs against `"step-header-tagger"`
   from inside counting, because the plugin id is passed by hand at every call site.
4. **Curriculum is imported by name.** `Home.tsx` imports `FLOWING_LEVELS` directly from
   `src/counting/data/countingAssets.ts`. A second skill cannot contribute lessons without
   the dashboard importing it too.
5. **No routing.** `activeTab` is React state with no URL, so refreshing inside a lesson
   returns the learner to the dashboard.

---

## 2. Why a plugin does not own levels

The obvious design — each plugin ships its own curriculum — breaks immediately. The counting
plugin's 15 levels already span five different skills:

| Level | Title | Actually teaches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1–L2 | Count in a Row / Scattered | counting |
| L3 | Comparing Two Groups | **comparing** |
| L4–L5 | Dice Patterns / Dot Groups | counting |
| L6–L8 | Part-Whole, Ten-Frame, Making 10 | **number bonds** (+ addition) |
| L9 | Teen Numbers (10 + Ones) | **base ten** |
| L10–L11 | Skip Counting by 2s, 5s, 10s | **multiplication** precursor |
| L13–L15 | Make a Ten / Hundred / Build Numbers | **base ten** |

A `number-bonds` plugin would collide with counting L6–L8 on its first day. The overlap is
not an accident to be tidied up — teaching counting well *requires* touching number bonds.

**So capability and curriculum are separated:**

- A **plugin** owns *activities* — interaction engines. It answers **how** a learner interacts.
- The **course** owns *order* — which lesson comes when. It answers **what** is taught, when.
- A **lesson** binds the two: it points at an activity and configures it.

Counting's "Making 10" lesson then *references* `number-bonds/ten-frame` instead of shipping
a second implementation. Nothing is owned twice, and no boundary has to be argued.

| Unit of… | Lives in | So that… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership | `plugins/<skill>/` | one developer owns one folder, complete |
| Reuse | `plugin.activities` | counting can *use* a ten-frame without owning it |
| Sequencing | `curriculum/course.ts` | lesson order changes without touching a skill |

---

## 3. The contract

Defined in [`src/plugins/types.ts`](../src/plugins/types.ts).

```ts
export interface SkillPlugin {
  manifest: PluginManifest;
  features: PluginFeature[];                        // existing pluginStore shape
  settings: Record<string, unknown>;
  activities: Record<string, ActivityDefinition>;   // what this skill CAN DO
  lessons: Lesson[];                                // what this skill TEACHES
}

export interface ActivityDefinition<P> {
  id: string;                 // "touch-orbit" → referenced as "counting/touch-orbit"
  name: string;
  defaultParams: P;
  component: React.ComponentType<ActivityProps<P>>;
}

export interface ActivityProps<P> {
  params: P;                  // lesson config, merged over defaultParams
  level: number;
  koda: KodaSDK;              // the global API, pre-bound to this plugin
  onComplete(result: SkillResult): void;
}

export interface Lesson {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  concept: string;            // what mastery is tracked against
  activity: string;           // "number-bonds/ten-frame" — MAY be another plugin's
  params?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

A plugin declares what it teaches, but **not where its lessons sit in the global order**.
That belongs to the course, so two skills can never fight over a lesson.

---

## 4. The global API

Everything the host offers arrives as one injected object. Koda already provides all of it —
it is just imported directly today, which is what couples skills to the app.

```ts
export interface KodaSDK {
  readonly pluginId: string;

  sound:   { play(type: SoundType): void };
  haptics: { tap(): void; success(): void };
  speech:  { say(text: string, opts?: { rate?: number }): Promise<void>; stop(): void };

  // XP is a HOST api. A skill reports what was earned; it never owns the
  // running total, because that total is shared across all skills.
  progress: {
    awardXp(amount: number): Promise<void>;
    complete(result: SkillResult): Promise<void>;
    snapshot(): Promise<LearnerSnapshot>;   // a copy, never live state
    // What to do next, across every installed skill. A host API for the same
    // reason XP is: the answer may well be "leave this skill".
    nextStep(): Promise<Recommendation | undefined>;
  };

  // Learning telemetry. A skill reports facts; the SDK derives every number,
  // which is what makes the data comparable across skills.
  // Full contract: docs/LEARNING_LOG.md
  learning: {
    startLesson(entry?: LessonEntry, levelNumber?: number): void;
    present(q: { questionId: string; index: number; taskKind: string;
                 expected?: string; itemCount?: number }): void;
    answered(r: AnswerReport): void;
    supportUsed(support: SupportKind, hintLevel?: number): void;
    completeLesson(extras?: { stars?: number; xpEarned?: number }): void;
    abandonLesson(): void;
  };

  ai: {
    tutor(message: string, ctx?: object): Promise<string>;
    generateProblem(spec: object): Promise<unknown>;
    analyzeDrawing(png: string): Promise<string>;
  };

  config: {                                  // pre-bound to THIS plugin's id
    get<T>(key: string, fallback: T): T;
    isEnabled(featureId: string): boolean;
  };

  log(action: PluginAction, detail: string): void;
  ui: { readonly theme: "light" | "dark"; exit(): void };
}
```

### Backed by what already exists

| Global call | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `koda.sound.play()` | `src/utils/audio.ts` → `playSound()` |
| `koda.haptics.tap()` | `src/utils/haptics.ts` → `triggerTapPopHaptic()` |
| `koda.speech.say()` | `POST /api/tutor/speech`, falls back to `speakWebSpeech()` |
| `koda.progress.awardXp()` | `App.tsx` → `setUserProgress` |
| `koda.ai.tutor()` | `POST /api/tutor/respond` |
| `koda.ai.generateProblem()` | `POST /api/tutor/generate-problem` |
| `koda.ai.analyzeDrawing()` | `POST /api/tutor/analyze-drawing` |
| `koda.config.isEnabled()` | `PluginManagerAPI.isFeatureEnabled()` |
| `koda.log()` | `PluginManagerAPI.logAction()` |

### Two rules that keep this cheap later

**Injected, never `window.Koda`.** A real global cannot be versioned, mocked in tests, scoped
per plugin, or reached from an iframe. Injection reads identically for the developer and
keeps all four doors open.

**Async wherever a boundary could ever exist.** `awardXp()` returns a `Promise` although
today it is a synchronous `setState`. That single choice makes a later sandbox/RPC swap a
drop-in instead of a rewrite of every skill.

`koda.config.isEnabled()` and `koda.log()` take **no plugin id** — the host binds it once. A
skill therefore cannot read another plugin's flags or log under another plugin's name, which
is the bug at `CountingGameApp.tsx:717` today.

### What a skill must never reach

Raw `localStorage` (namespace it under the plugin id), direct `fetch` (proxy through the host
so the Gemini key never leaks), the DOM outside its own root, another plugin's data, or app
state. **This list is the permissions model** — far cheaper to hold from the first plugin
than to retrofit onto nine.

## 5. Folder layout

```

├── kit/                      # shared skill furniture — use it, do not rebuild it
│   ├── round/                #   useSkillRound, scoreRound
│   └── chrome/               #   SkillRound, SkillRoundTopBar, step header, complete modal
│
├── addition/                 # the reference skill — read this one
│   ├── index.ts              # export const plugin: SkillPlugin
│   ├── manifest.json         # metadata, listing, features, settings defaults
│   ├── lessons.json          # the lessons it contributes
│   └── activities/           # what it EXPORTS for anyone to reference
│       └── AdditionSprint.tsx#   → "addition/sprint"
│
└── counting/                 # the older skill: same contract, own round loop
    ├── index.ts
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── lessons.json
    ├── activities/
    └── internal/             # private — nothing outside this folder imports it
```

`index.ts` is the **only** file the rest of the app may import from a plugin.

### The kit

Roughly 80% of `CountingGameApp.tsx` (3,053 lines) is not about counting — it is round
sequencing, scoring, stars, streaks, hints, the progress bar, the feedback banner and the
completion modal. If that stays inside the counting folder, skills 2–9 each copy it.

```
src/plugins/kit/
├── round/     useSkillRound, useScoring, types
├── chrome/    SkillTopBar, SkillPrompt, SkillFeedback, RoundComplete
├── manipulatives/
│   ├── TappableSet.tsx   → counting, comparing
│   ├── DragBin.tsx       → sorting, base-ten
│   ├── TenFrame.tsx      → number bonds, addition
│   ├── NumberLine.tsx    → addition, subtraction
│   └── BalanceScale.tsx  → comparing, equations
└── answer/    ChoiceGrid, NumberPad
```

**Extract the kit during the counting migration, before skill two exists.** If skill two is
built first, the kit has to be reverse-engineered from two divergent implementations.

With the kit, an activity is mostly declaration:

```tsx
// src/plugins/comparing/activities/BalanceCompare.tsx
export function BalanceCompare({ params, level, koda, onComplete }: ActivityProps<CompareParams>) {
  const round = useSkillRound({ questions: buildQuestions(level, params) });

  return (
    <SkillShell onExit={koda.ui.exit}>
      <SkillTopBar level={level} progress={round.progress} />
      <SkillPrompt text={round.question.prompt} onSpeak={koda.speech.say} />

      {/* the only genuinely comparing-specific part */}
      <BalanceScale
        left={round.question.left}
        right={round.question.right}
        onSettle={(v) => { koda.sound.play(v.correct ? "success" : "error"); round.answer(v); }}
      />

      <SkillFeedback state={round.feedback} />
      <RoundComplete
        result={round.result}
        onDone={async (r) => { await koda.progress.awardXp(r.xpEarned); onComplete(r); }}
      />
    </SkillShell>
  );
}
```

---

## 6. Registry and course

```ts
// src/plugins/registry.ts
export const PLUGINS: SkillPlugin[] = [counting, numberBonds, comparing];

// Every activity from every plugin, addressable as "plugin/activity".
// This is the reuse surface — no cross-folder imports.
export const resolveActivity = (ref: string) => {
  const [pluginId, activityId] = ref.split("/");
  return PLUGINS.find((p) => p.manifest.id === pluginId)?.activities[activityId];
};
```

```ts
// src/curriculum/course.ts — sequencing, and nothing else
export const COURSE: Unit[] = [
  {
    id: "u1", title: "Subitizing & Dot Matrix", icon: "🌱",
    lessons: [
      "counting/count-in-a-row",
      "counting/count-scattered",
      "comparing/two-groups",       // another skill, mid-unit. Fine.
      "counting/dice-patterns",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "u2", title: "Ten-Frames & Place Value", icon: "⚡",
    lessons: [
      "number-bonds/part-whole",
      "number-bonds/making-10",     // the old counting L8. Now owned once.
      "base-ten/teen-numbers",
    ],
  },
];
```

Reordering the course, A/B-testing a sequence, or shipping a Grade 2 variant is a data change
here. No skill folder is touched.

---

## 7. Adding a new skill

1. **Start from the reference skill.** `addition/` is the smallest complete example —
   manifest, lessons, one activity built on the kit, registered in two places.
   `docs/NEW_SKILL_PROMPT.md` is the standard prompt that builds one from it. Read
   `addition`, not `counting`: counting predates the kit and still runs its own round loop.
2. **Declare the manifest.** Kebab-case `id`, a category, the feature flags the skill checks
   at runtime, and settings defaults so Plugin Lab can render controls before the skill runs.
3. **Export your activities.** Check the registry first — if the interaction already exists
   (a ten-frame, a number line), reference it instead of writing a second one.
4. **Write your lessons** in `lessons.ts`, each pointing at an activity and configuring it.
5. **Register it** — one import, one array entry in `registry.ts`.
6. **Place lessons in the course** (`curriculum/course.ts`). Along with the registry, this is
   the only edit outside your folder.
7. **Verify in Plugin Lab.** Toggle the plugin off and confirm it leaves the sidebar,
   dashboard and routes; toggle each feature and confirm behaviour changes.

### Curriculum standards — the rule

Each lesson carries its own `standards` array. Nobody validates it, so the rule is a
convention every skill follows rather than something the build enforces. Six lines:

1. **Copy the code, never invent it.** Take the exact published string —
   `CCSS.K.CC.B.4a`, not `K.CC.4a` or `CCSS.K.CC.B.4.a`. Format is
   `CCSS.<grade>.<domain>.<cluster>.<item>`, no spaces. A wrong code is worse than none,
   because a teacher will believe it.

2. **Check what an existing lesson used.** Before writing a code for "counting a row of
   objects", search `lessons.json` across the plugins for a lesson teaching the same thing
   and reuse its codes. Two skills labelling one idea differently is the failure this rule
   exists to prevent, and grep is the only thing standing in the way.

3. **First is primary.** Plugin Lab's lesson list shows `standards[0]` and nothing else, so
   put the code the lesson is chiefly about at the front. The rest are visible in the lesson
   detail panel. Order is meaning, not alphabetical.

4. **List what the lesson is assessed on, not what it brushes past.** The test: if a child
   fails this lesson, are they failing that standard? If not, leave it out. Three codes is a
   lot; one is normal.

5. **Empty is a real answer.** `"standards": []` means the framework has no code for this
   skill. Subitizing is the standing example — Quick Dice Patterns and Quick Dot Groups both
   ship empty, deliberately. Never reach for an approximate code just to fill the field.

6. **If it is empty, `trajectoryLevel` must not be.** A lesson may sit outside the official
   standards, but it may not sit outside both frameworks. The Clements & Sarama trajectory
   position carries the pedagogical claim when Common Core has nothing to say.

Two things are deliberately *not* in this list. There is no central table mapping concepts to
codes: skills own their own data, and the cost of that is drift you catch by reading, not by
tooling. And the codes drive nothing — they are displayed, never computed on. `conceptKey` is
the field that does the work, and unlike `standards` it must never be empty or invented,
because mastery tracking aggregates on it.

### 7.1 Tests — what a new skill inherits

Testing a skill is mostly not writing tests. `src/skills/kit/testing/` holds the suite every
skill is held to, so a new skill's structural test file is two lines:

```ts
import { describeSkillContract, describeActivitySmoke } from "../kit/testing";
import { skill } from ".";

describeSkillContract(skill);   // manifest, lessons, refs, requires chain, settings
describeActivitySmoke(skill);   // every registered activity mounts and opens a round
```

That alone catches the class of bug that actually happens here: a lesson pointing at an
activity that was renamed, a `requires` naming a concept nothing teaches, two lessons claiming
level 7, a settings field describing a setting that does not exist. None of those are type
errors — they are strings inside JSON — and every one of them shipped at least once while
counting was being built.

**Behaviour** needs one small driver per activity, because only the skill knows what its own
buttons mean:

```ts
await expectStandardRound(activity, async (h) => {
  await h.press(/^Show me$/);
  await h.settle();                       // let a flash or animation finish
  await h.press(new RegExp(`^${expected(h)}$`));
});
```

`expectStandardRound` then asserts the part that is the same for every skill: `startLesson`
lands before the first `present`, every answer is reported, the log closes once, XP is awarded
once through the SDK, `onComplete` fires once, and a clean round is three stars.

Two rules make these drivers stable:

- **Read the answer out of the telemetry, never recompute it.** `expected(h)` reads what the
  activity told the host via `learning.present`. A test that recomputes the answer can drift
  from the activity; one that reads it cannot, and a missing `expected` fails loudly instead
  of passing quietly.
- **Drive by accessible name.** `press(/^Object 3\b/)` works because the button carries an
  `aria-label`. An icon- or emoji-only control with no label is both untestable and unusable
  with a screen reader — if a driver cannot find a control, that is the bug.

The fake SDK (`createFakeKoda`) records every host call, so a test can assert on what the
host *would have received* — which is the real contract, and is otherwise invisible: a round
can look perfect on screen while filing no learning events at all.

### Definition of done

- [ ] Imports nothing from another plugin folder. Reuse goes through
      `resolveActivity("plugin/activity")` or `kit/`. **A direct cross-folder import is the
      failure mode that ends modularity** — worth a lint rule.
- [ ] Touches the host only through `koda`. No direct import of `playSound`,
      `PluginManagerAPI`, or app state.
- [ ] Owns no lesson that belongs to another skill. If a lesson teaches number bonds it lives
      in the number-bonds folder, even when it appears inside a counting unit.
- [ ] Nothing outside imports past its `index.ts`.
- [ ] Correct in light **and** dark, built on `themeSystem` tokens and checked in both.
- [ ] Disabling it removes it from sidebar, dashboard and routes.
- [ ] Logs under its own id only.
- [ ] Built on `kit/` — `useSkillRound` for the loop, `SkillRound` for the chrome. A skill
      that hand-rolls either will drift from every other skill, which is how one round
      ended up with its own top bar and a non-standard feedback message.
- [ ] Sets no XP anywhere. One rate lives in Settings; stars come from first-try accuracy.
- [ ] Reaches the host only through `koda` — including sound, haptics and speech.
- [ ] Every lesson names a `conceptKey` that already exists if the skill is not new, and
      carries `standards` codes copied from the published source — or an empty array plus a
      `trajectoryLevel`. See the rule above.
- [ ] Keyboard reachable; state never carried by colour alone.
- [ ] Entry component under ~300 lines. Past that, the generic part belongs in the kit.
- [ ] Has `<skill>.test.ts` calling `describeSkillContract` and `describeActivitySmoke`, and a
      round test per activity. See §7.1 — this is two lines plus one small driver each.
- [ ] `npm test` green.

## 8. Lifecycle — from folder to learner

| # | Stage | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Build from the template | developer | `draft` |
| 2 | Register (one line) | developer | `draft` |
| 3 | **Verify in Plugin Lab** (the gate) | developer | `draft` |
| 4 | Promote to beta | you | `beta` |
| 5 | Place lessons in the course | curriculum owner | `beta` |
| 6 | Publish — merge and deploy | you | `published` |
| 7 | Parent/teacher toggles per install | parent | — |

`status` lets a skill **ship in the bundle but stay hidden from learners**, which is what
makes releasing safe. One resolver decides visibility, consulted by the sidebar, dashboard
and router:

```ts
export const visibleTo = (p: SkillPlugin, viewer: Viewer) =>
  p.manifest.status === "published" ? matchesAudience(p, viewer) && enabledForInstall(p.manifest.id)
: p.manifest.status === "beta"      ? viewer.betaOptIn && enabledForInstall(p.manifest.id)
: /* draft */                         viewer.isDeveloper;
```

Stage 5 is deliberately separate from code review: whoever decides pedagogy is usually not
the person who wrote the component, and placing lessons touches no code.

> **Scope.** This is build-time distribution — "publish" means a status change plus a deploy
> of our own app. Nobody outside this repo can ship a plugin. Stages 1–3 and 7 are identical
> in a third-party store; only 4–6 would change, growing a review queue, signed bundles and a
> registry service. See §10.

---

## 9. Managing plugins

`src/components/PluginSettingsPanel.tsx`, rendered from `SettingsPage.tsx:188`, already
provides per-feature toggles, engine fine-tuning (speech rate, bounce scale, haptic
intensity), a live interaction sandbox, filterable action logs, and export/import of the
whole config as JSON.

Two changes make it a *plugin* manager rather than a *counting* manager:

- **Read the registry.** `selectedPluginId` defaults to `"counting-mastery"`, the feature list
  reads `countingPlugin.features`, and there is a literal "Reset Counting Defaults" button.
  Skill two would not appear.
- **Show release status**, so draft and beta skills are visible here and nowhere else.

---

## 10. Open decisions

- **Lazy loading.** `ActivityDefinition.component` can be a `React.lazy` import so each skill
  is its own chunk. Worth doing from the start — the bundle is already ~492 KB.
- **Runtime vs build-time.** This design is build-time. True third-party loading needs a
  frozen SDK, a loader, sandboxing, and a permissions model. Do not freeze an SDK validated
  against a single skill.
- **Two taxonomies.** `skillTreeRoadmap.ts` uses `stage_baseten` / `stage_fractions`;
  `types.ts` `TopicCategory` uses `base_ten_blocks` / `fraction_lab`, and each list has
  entries the other lacks. **Proposal: the plugin id becomes canonical** (kebab-case, no
  prefix) and `TopicCategory` derives from the registry. Settle this before ids are baked in.
- **Versioning.** `manifest.version` exists but nothing reads it. Decide whether stored
  settings migrate when a plugin's version changes.
- **Reclassify the fragment plugins.** `step-header-tagger`, `feedback-drawer` and friends in
  `DEFAULT_PLUGINS` are UI fragments of counting, not skills. They should become `features` of
  the counting plugin rather than peers of it.
